list of changes introduced into trunk version started on 4.4.2014 (started from revision 223 and some minor style changes as well as something commented out that caused crashes (look in labbook) and changes in analyses and addition of botho analyses)

tbconfig.cc
	- extensively commented TbConfig::loop()
	
looper.h
	- corrected comments and deleted old function declaration
	(void processRuns(vector<int> runs)) that has no definition in looper.cc
	anymore
	
looper.cc

	- LOTS of comments in buildEvent
!!!!	- in init function added 
			gr_Alpha = new std::vector<double>;
			gr_Beta  = new std::vector<double>;
			gr_Gamma = new std::vector<double>;
			gr_RotXYErr = new std::vector<double>;
			gr_RotZXErr = new std::vector<double>;
